*Installing Gerrit for me has not been the easiest task I've taken on so 
I wanted to get together some documentation about installing both Git 
and Gerrit to be used on our servers in a corporate environment.

Due to our corporate IT standard of installing/supporting RHEL5 servers, 
I decided I needed to perform all my setup/testing/troubleshooting on CentOS 5.4 
since it mirrored the RHEL5 environment almost identically and you don't need to 
have a software license subscriptin or entitlement to use yum to install/upgrade 
packages with dependencies.

Depending on who you are or talk to some people tend to prefer installing many 
packages from source due to its configuration and ability to customize. However, 
coming into any organization with installed packages always become a headache 
for any new administrator that comes in and has to take over and learn about what's 
installed, how it's installed, and more importantly how to upgrade it or support it. 

I've also discussed this with many so-called Linux experts on IRC and many have either 
scolded me or highly criticized admins saying installing from source is so irresponsible 
probably mostly due to the reasons listed above. 

So even though many developers use and prefer to install from source and are most utilize Fedora 
with the latest release, they typically don't have to support these machines other than doing their own 
backups but supporting servers in the corporate environment in a whole different animal. 
Let's make everyone's life easier and just compromise a bit =0).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'll be writing up all steps I went through for my setup and what I used.
Things such as:
-what packages installed
-any dependancies I downloaded/installed outside of yum
-steps I used to build things like git
-MySQL setup steps
-PostgreSQL setup steps *Moved to this cuz need to get this working for my job.
-any Troubleshooting and workarounds I figured out somehow/someway. 
Basically any other setup steps that should provide me with enough to perform a successful 
Git/Gerrit setup on any RHEL/CentOS server.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Keep in mind that I found different HowTos & Installation procedures for Gerrit (some recent and some a bit 
out of date) steps online and this may or may not work for you and your setup but it did for me and should 
allow me to use these steps for sometime with our servers.
