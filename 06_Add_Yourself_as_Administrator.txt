Needed to know how to accomplish adding myself as Administrator:
================================================================

To add yourself as an administrator, you'll need to either get another
admin to add you, or force your user account in by hand:

 INSERT INTO account_group_members
 (group_id, account_id)
 VALUES
 ((SELECT admin_group_id FROM system_config),
 YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID
 );

Just get YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID from the Settings page.  When you are done
with the insert, restart the server so it picks up your new group
membership.

On server:
===========

[root@san-gerrit1 gerrit2]# sudo -u postgres psql -d reviewdb
Welcome to psql 8.1.21, the PostgreSQL interactive terminal.

Type:  \copyright for distribution terms
       \h for help with SQL commands
       \? for help with psql commands
       \g or terminate with semicolon to execute query
       \q to quit

reviewdb=# \c reviewdb
You are now connected to database "reviewdb".
reviewdb=# INSERT INTO account_group_members
reviewdb-# (group_id, account_id)
reviewdb-# VALUES
reviewdb-# ((SELECT admin_group_id FROM system_config),
reviewdb(# 1000082
reviewdb(# );
INSERT 0 1
reviewdb=# \q

Now need to Restert gerrit.sh to take effect!!!
Now it shows me (1000082) in Administrator group:

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


 INSERT INTO account_group_members
 (group_id, account_id)
 VALUES
 ((SELECT admin_group_id FROM system_config),
 1000025
 );
