Needed to know how to accomplish adding myself as Administrator:
================================================================

To add yourself as an administrator, you'll need to either get another
admin to add you, or force your user account in by hand:

 INSERT INTO account_group_members
 (group_id, account_id)
 VALUES
 ((SELECT admin_group_id FROM system_config),
 YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID
 );

Just get YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID from the Settings page.  When you are done
with the insert, restart the server so it picks up your new group
membership.
