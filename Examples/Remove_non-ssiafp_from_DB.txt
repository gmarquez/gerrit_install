su gerrit2
cd /home/gerrit2

psql -d reviewdb -U gerrit2

reviewdb=> DELETE FROM projects
reviewdb-> WHERE name <> (SELECT wild_project_name FROM system_config)
reviewdb-> AND name NOT LIKE 'ssiafp/%';

ERROR:  relation "patches" does not exist


From Shawn:
Yea, that's OK.  We stopped caching that data in the database.  It
cost more to write to the DB than it did to generate it on the fly.
Just ignore that statement.  :-)

***Let's move on***

reviewdb=> DELETE FROM starred_changes WHERE
reviewdb-> change_id NOT IN (SELECT change_id FROM changes);
DELETE 3

-- ### Stopped here for reviewdb_TEST1 ###

-- This table might have already been removed, that's OK.
--
DELETE FROM patch_set_info WHERE
change_id NOT IN (SELECT change_id FROM changes);

reviewdb=> DELETE FROM patch_set_info WHERE
reviewdb-> change_id NOT IN (SELECT change_id FROM changes);
ERROR:  relation "patch_set_info" does not exist


*** Okay moving along ***


-- Depending on the schema version, this table may be
-- called "ref_rights" instead:
--
-- NO project_rights found, use ref_rights:

--DELETE FROM project_rights WHERE

DELETE FROM ref_rights WHERE
project_name NOT IN (SELECT name FROM projects);

*** On reviewdb_TEST1 ***
reviewdb_TEST1=> DELETE FROM ref_rights WHERE
reviewdb_TEST1-> project_name NOT IN (SELECT name FROM projects);
DELETE 1709


*On one occasion it found something in project_right, dunno.
*Ouch removed a lot on this one:

reviewdb=> DELETE FROM project_rights WHERE
reviewdb-> project_name NOT IN (SELECT name FROM projects);
DELETE 1696

*This one too (same amount):

reviewdb=> DELETE FROM ref_rights WHERE
reviewdb-> project_name NOT IN (SELECT name FROM projects);
DELETE 1696


# Stopping here first to check if we removed non-ssiafp repos!!!


NOW lets change ssiafp pre-fix:
===============================

reviewdb=> UPDATE projects SET name = SUBSTR(name, LENGTH('ssiafp/') + 1)
reviewdb-> WHERE name <> (SELECT wild_project_name FROM system_config);
UPDATE 293

reviewdb=> UPDATE ref_rights SET project_name = SUBSTR(project_name, LENGTH('ssiafp/') + 1)
reviewdb-> WHERE project_name <> (SELECT wild_project_name FROM system_config);
UPDATE 3623

reviewdb=> UPDATE changes SET dest_project_name = SUBSTR(dest_project_name, LENGTH('ssiafp/') + 1);
UPDATE 1427

reviewdb=> UPDATE account_project_watches SET project_name = SUBSTR(project_name, LENGTH('ssiafp/') + 1);
UPDATE 305


NO errors, seems okay!!!


# Change ssiafp pre-fix name to use /android1/android/git/ or gerrit.config file.
# Commands to paste:
=====================
UPDATE projects SET name = SUBSTR(name, LENGTH('ssiafp/') + 1)
WHERE name <> (SELECT wild_project_name FROM system_config);

UPDATE ref_rights SET project_name = SUBSTR(project_name, LENGTH('ssiafp/') + 1)
WHERE project_name <> (SELECT wild_project_name FROM system_config);

UPDATE changes SET dest_project_name = SUBSTR(dest_project_name, LENGTH('ssiafp/') + 1);

UPDATE account_project_watches SET project_name = SUBSTR(project_name, LENGTH('ssiafp/') + 1);
